# 🌐 Worldcoin ETHCC Events Mini App — Social Reputation via Hypergraph

We built a **Worldcoin Mini App** that transforms ETHCC side events into a **frictionless social layer** inside the **World App**.

> 🧠 Human-verified feedback. 📊 Event insights. 🧭 No wallets or logins needed.

---

## 🎯 What it does

This Mini App scrapes **ETHCC side events from Luma** and lets World App users:

- ✅ **Mark attendance**
- 💬 **Comment** on events
- ⭐️ **Rate** them with a score

All interactions are stored and modeled using **The Graph’s Knowledge Graph**, creating a structured, composable data layer of:

- Who attended what
- What users thought (comment & score)
- How events trend within the community

This enables **portable, Sybil-resistant reputation** for events and attendees — right from the **World App**.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **🌀 Worldcoin Mini App SDK** — identity & UI inside World App
- **📡 Hypergraph (GRC-20)** — semantic data modeling via The Graph
- **💻 Next.js + Tailwind** — frontend
- **🗃 IPFS + Smart Account (Geo)** — data publication & signing

---

## 🚀 Why it matters

- **No wallets or logins** — built directly into World App UX
- **Sybil-resistant** — every interaction is verified with World ID
- **Composability** — all reviews and relationships are open & queryable
- **Community value** — understand event quality via real human feedback

This is the **first layer of portable reputation for IRL events**, verified by Worldcoin and stored in The Graph for anyone to build on top.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> _"Which ETHCC side events are most loved by real attendees?"_  
> _"How does attendance correlate with DAO contributors?"_

Thanks to The Graph's semantic structure, these questions are answerable out-of-the-box via simple queries.
